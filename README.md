# Neural-Style-Transfer
PyTorch implementation from scratch of the original neural style transfer paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576). The model was trained with a pretrained VGG19 CNN architecture using the Adam optimizer. A faster convergence was obtained using a second order L-BFGS optimizer.
